# Contributing

Thanks for helping improve Free Claude Code. Keep changes focused, test the behavior you change, and preserve the public Claude Code and Codex workflows.

## Before Opening A Pull Request

- Open an issue before proposing README changes.
- Do not open Docker integration pull requests.
- For bugs, include every model mapping, the active model when the failure occurred, the complete error, and reproducible steps.
- Add focused tests for behavior changes and relevant edge cases.

## Pull Request Titles

Changes to `assets/`, `scripts/`, `src/`, `pyproject.toml`, or `uv.lock` require a title starting with `patch: `, `minor: `, or `major: ` followed by a description. Use exactly one space after the colon.

PRs without changes to those paths must not use a release prefix. Do not edit version numbers. Publishing calculates the version after merge, creates its Git tag, and publishes to PyPI and GitHub Releases.

## Development Setup

Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), then run directly from the checkout. uv automatically installs the Python version required by the project.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Alishahryar1/free-claude-code.git
cd free-claude-code
uv run fcc-server
```

Use `uv run` for Python commands. Do not run the project with a global Python interpreter.

## Quality Checks

Run the complete local CI sequence before opening a pull request:

```bash
./scripts/ci.sh
```

```powershell
.\scripts\ci.ps1
```

Useful iteration flags are `--only`, `--skip`, and `--dry-run` on macOS/Linux, or `-Only`, `-Skip`, and `-DryRun` in PowerShell.

Individual repair and test commands:

```bash
uv run ruff format
uv run ruff check --fix
uv run ty check
uv run pytest -v --tb=short
```

GitHub CI runs Ruff in check-only mode and also bans `# type: ignore`, `# ty: ignore`, and legacy annotation workarounds. Fix underlying typing and import-boundary problems instead of suppressing them.

## Project Standards

- Target Python 3.14 and rely on native lazy annotations; do not add `from __future__ import annotations`.
- Python 3.14 supports multiple exception types without parentheses, such as `except TypeError, ValueError:`.
- Keep shared Anthropic protocol behavior under `src/free_claude_code/core/anthropic/` rather than importing utilities from another provider.
- Keep provider-specific configuration in the provider that owns it.
- Remove dead compatibility code when completing migrations unless preserving a published interface is explicitly required.
